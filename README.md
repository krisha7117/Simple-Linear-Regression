# Simple-Linear-Regression
## Type of simple regression model 

### Simple Linear Regression Notebook mainly focused on :
  - Observing how linear is relationship of dependent variable with other independent variables using plots 
  - Process of training model using sklearn packages for simple linear regression model
  - Model Evaluation for regression models

### Dataset Used :
  - FuelConsumption.csv (csv file is uploaded above)

### Objective :
  - How Engine_Size is responsible for CO2 emission by vehicle
  - Fitting a linear model with co-efficient B = (B1,....Bn) to minimize the "residual sum of squares" between the actual value in dataset and the prediced value by         model using linear approximation
